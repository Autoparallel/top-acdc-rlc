  abstract = {The symplectic and Poisson structures on reduced phase spaces are reviewed, including the symplectic structure on coadjoint orbits of a Lie group and the Lie-Poisson structure on the dual of a Lie algebra. These results are applied to plasma physics. We show in three steps how the Maxwell-Vlasov equations for a collisionless plasma can be written in Hamiltonian form relative to a certain Poisson bracket. First, the Poisson-Vlasov equations are shown to be in Hamiltonian form relative to the Lie-Poisson bracket on the dual of the (ﬁnite dimensional) Lie algebra of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations. Then we write Maxwell’s equations in Hamiltonian form using the canonical symplectic structure on the phase space of the electromagnetic ﬁelds, regarded as a gauge theory. In the last step we couple these two systems via the reduction procedure for interacting systems. We also show that two other standard models in plasma physics, ideal MHD and two-ﬂuid electrodynamics, can be written in Hamiltonian form using similar group theoretic techniques.},

The central problem of defining the electromagnetic constitutive law is elaborated upon in the linear and nonlinear cases. The manner by which the spacetime metric might follow from the constitutive law is examined in the linear case. The possibility that the intersection form of the spacetime manifold might play a role in defining a topological basis for the constitutive law is explored. The manner by which wave motion might follow from the electromagnetic structure is also discussed.},

Additional topics include equivariant K-theory, the G-index theorem, and Bott's paper "The Index Theorem for Homogeneous Differential Operators". It also includes an appendix with a proof of Bott periodicity, as well as sketches of proofs for both the standard and equivariant versions of the K-theory Thom isomorphism theorem, in terms of the index for families of elliptic operators. A second appendix derives the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. This text originated as notes from a series of lectures given by the author as an undergraduate at Princeton. In its current form, the author has used it for graduate courses at the University of Oregon.},

The development of algebraic topology since Maxwell provides a framework for linking data structures, algorithms, and computation to topological aspects of three-dimensional electromagnetic boundary value problems. This book attempts to expose the link between Maxwell and a modern approach to algorithms. The first chapters lay out the relevant facts about homology and cohomology, stressing their interpretations in electromagnetism. These topological structures are subsequently tied to variational formulations in electromagnetics, the finite element method, algorithms, and certain aspects of numerical linear algebra. A recurring theme is the formulation of and algorithms for the problem of making branch cuts for computing magnetic scalar potentials and eddy currents. Appendices bridge the gap between the material presented and standard expositions of differential forms, Hodge decompositions, and tools for realizing representatives of homology classes as embedded manifolds.},

It is elementary, assuming only a modest background from readers, making it suitable for a wide variety of students and course structures. Its selection of topics has been deemed "superb" by teachers who have used the text. A significant feature of the book is its powerful and revealing structure, beginning simply with the definition of a differentiable manifold and ending with one of the most important results in Riemannian geometry, a proof of the Sphere Theorem. The text abounds with basic definitions and theorems, examples, applications, and numerous exercises to test the student's understanding and extend knowledge and insight into the subject. Instructors and students alike will find the work to be a significant contribution to this highly applicable and stimulating subject.},

  abstract = {Based on a theoretical model of the propagation of electromagnetic waves through a hypersonically induced plasma, it has been demonstrated that the classical radiofrequency communications blackout that is experienced during atmospheric reentry can be mitigated through the appropriate control of an external magnetic field of nominal magnitude. The model is based on the kinetic equation treatment of Vlasov and involves an analytical solution for the electric and magnetic fields within the plasma allowing for a description of the attendant transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients. The ability to transmit through the magnetized plasma is due to the ‘magnetic windows’ that are created within the plasma via the well-known ‘whistler modes’ of propagation. The case of 2 GHz transmission through a re-entry plasma is considered. The coefficients are found to be highly sensitive to the prevailing electron density and will thus require a dynamic control mechanism to vary the magnetic field as the plasma evolves through the re-entry phase.},

The course was designed for students who had a basic understanding of singular homol­ ogy, CW-complexes, applications of the existence and uniqueness theorem for O.D.E.s to vector fields on smooth Riemannian manifolds, and Sard's Theo­ rem.

We would especially like to thank Chris Saunders for his dedication and en­ thusiasm concerning this project and the many helpful suggestions he made throughout the development of this text. We would also like to thank Bob Wells for sharing with us his extensive knowledge of CW-complexes, Morse theory, and singular homology.

The basic geometric structure underlying such a theory is that of a spacetime continuum or, in mathematical terms, a 4-dimensionaldifferentiable manifoldX4. The characteristics of the gravitational field will be determined by the nature of the additional geometric structures that are superimposed on this “bare manifold” X4. For instance, in Einstein’s general relativity theory (GR), the manifold is endowed with ametrictogether with a torsion-free, metric-compatible connection: It is a 4-dimensional Riemannian spacetime V4. The meanings of these terms are explained in detail in what follows.},

  abstract = {This is an introduction to geometric algebra, an alternative to traditional vector algebra that expands on it in two ways: 1. In addition to scalars and vectors, it defines new objects representing subspaces of any dimension. 2. It defines a product that's strongly motivated by geometry and can be taken between any two objects. For example, the product of two vectors taken in a certain way represents their common plane. This system was invented by William Clifford and is more commonly known as Clifford algebra. It's actually older than the vector algebra that we use today (due to Gibbs) and includes it as a subset. Over the years, various parts of Clifford algebra have been reinvented independently by many people who found they needed it, often not realizing that all those parts belonged in one system. This suggests that Clifford had the right idea, and that geometric algebra, not the reduced version we use today, deserves to be the standard "vector algebra." My goal in these notes is to describe geometric algebra from that standpoint and illustrate its usefulness. The notes are work in progress; I'll keep adding new topics as I learn them myself.},

We reformulate the Vlasov–Maxwell system in Morrison–Marsden–Weinstein Poisson bracket form. Then the Hamiltonian of this system is split into five parts, with which five corresponding Hamiltonian subsystems are obtained. The splitting method in time is derived by composing the solutions to these five subsystems. Combining the splitting method in time with the Fourier spectral method and finite volume method in space gives the full numerical discretizations which possess good conservation for the conserved quantities including energy, momentum, charge, etc. In numerical experiments, we simulate the Landau damping, Weibel instability and Bernstein wave to verify the numerical algorithms.},

In this paper, we explore certain properties associated with barotropic and non-barotropic fluid flows with the help of geometric algebra over a four-dimensional Euclidean space time manifold. We introduce the concepts of multivectors associated with vorticity, helicity, and parity, which evolve from a four-velocity field. In this context, the fluid dynamical analogs of the Poynting theorem, Lorentz force, and Maxwell’s equations are derived. The fluid Maxwell’s equations can be extracted from a single equation.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the relativistic kinetic theory for a simple collisionless gas from a geometric perspective. We start by reviewing the rich geometrical structure of the tangent bundle TM of a given spacetime manifold, including the splitting of the tangent spaces of TM into horizontal and vertical subspaces and the natural metric and symplectic structure it induces on TM. Based on these structures we introduce the Liouville vector field L and a suitable Hamiltonian function H on TM. The Liouville vector field turns out to be the Hamiltonian vector field associated to H. On the other hand, H also defines the mass shells as Lorentzian submanifolds of the tangent bundle. A simple collisionless gas is described by a distribution function on a particular mass shell, satisfying the Liouville equation. Together with the Liouville vector field the distribution function can be thought of as defining a fictitious incompressible fluid on the mass shells, with associated conserved current density. Flux integrals of this current density provide the averaged properties of the gas, while suitable fibre integrals of the distribution function define divergence-free tensor fields on the spacetime manifold such as the current density and stress-energy tensor. Finally, we discuss the relationship between symmetries of the spacetime manifold and symmetries of the distribution function. As a first application of our formalism we derive the most general spherically symmetric distribution function on any spherically symmetric spacetime and write the Einstein-Liouville equations as effective field equations on the two-dimensional radial manifold. As a second application we derive the most general collisionless distribution function on a Kerr black hole spacetime background.},

  abstract   = {We present a brief introduction to the relativistic kinetic theory of gases with emphasis on the underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure of the theory. Our formalism starts with a discussion on the tangent bundle of a Lorentzian manifold of arbitrary dimension. Next, we introduce the Poincare one-form on this bundle, from which the symplectic form and a volume form are constructed. Then, we define an appropriate Hamiltonian on the bundle which, together with the symplectic form yields the Liouville vector field. The corresponding flow, when projected onto the base manifold, generates geodesic motion. Whenever the flow is restricted to energy surfaces corresponding to a negative value of the Hamiltonian, its projection describes a family of future-directed timelike geodesics. A collisionless gas is described by a distribution function on such an energy surface, satisfying the Liouville equation. Fibre integrals of the distribution function determine the particle current density and the stress-energy tensor. We show that the stress-energy tensor satisfies the familiar energy conditions and that both the current and stress-energy tensor are divergence-free. Our discussion also includes the generalization to charged gases, a summary of the Einstein-Maxwell-Vlasov system in any dimensions, as well as a brief introduction to the general relativistic Boltzmann equation for a simple gas.},

  abstract = {We discuss the relativistic kinetic theory for a simple, collisionless, charged gas propagating on an arbitrary curved spacetime geometry. Our general relativistic treatment is formulated on the tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold and takes advantage of its rich geometric structure. In particular, we point out the existence of a natural metric on the tangent bundle and illustrate its role for the development of the relativistic kinetic theory. This metric, combined with the electromagnetic field of the spacetime, yields an appropriate symplectic form on the tangent bundle. The Liouville vector field arises as the Hamiltonian vector field of a natural Hamiltonian. The latter also defines natural energy surfaces, called mass shells, which turn out to be smooth Lorentzian submanifolds. A simple, collisionless, charged gas is described by a distribution function which is defined on the mass shell and satisfies the Liouville equation. Suitable fibre integrals of the distribution function define observable fields on the spacetime manifold, such as the current density and stress-energy tensor. Finally, the geometric setting of this work allows us to discuss the relationship between the symmetries of the electromagnetic field, those of the spacetime metric, and the symmetries of the distribution function. Taking advantage of these symmetries, we construct the most general solution of the Liouville equation an a Kerr-Newman black hole background.},

It contains guided problems, called homework, designed to complement the exposition or extend the reader's understanding. There are by now excellent references on symplectic geometry, a subset of which is in the bibliography of this book. However, the most efficient introduction to a subject is often a short elementary treatment, and these notes attempt to serve that purpose. This text provides a taste of areas of current research and will prepare the reader to explore recent papers and extensive books on symplectic geometry where the pace is much faster.

  abstract   = {These are lecture notes for a short winter course at the Department of Mathematics, University of Coimbra, Portugal, December 6--8, 2018. The course was part of the 13th International Young Researchers Workshop on Geometry, Mechanics and Control. In three lectures I trace the work of three heroes of mathematics and mechanics: Euler, Poincar{\textbackslash}'e, and Arnold. This leads up to the aim of the lectures: to explain Arnold's discovery from 1966 that solutions to Euler's equations for the motion of an incompressible fluid correspond to geodesics on the infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. In many ways, this discovery is the foundation for the field of geometric hydrodynamics, which today encompasses much more than just Euler's equations, with deep connections to many other fields such as optimal transport, shape analysis, and information theory.},

  abstract   = {This is the first entry in a planned series aiming to establish a modified, and simpler, formalism for studying the geometry of smooth manifolds with a metric, while remaining close to standard textbook treatments in terms of notation and concepts. The key step is extending the tangent space at each point from a vector space to a geometric algebra, which is a linear space incorporating vectors with dot and wedge multiplication, and extending the affine connection to a directional derivative acting naturally on fields of multivectors (elements of the geometric algebra). A short introduction to geometric algebra is included in the text. The theory that results from this extension is simpler and more powerful than either differential forms or tensor methods, in a number of ways. The multivector directional derivative obeys a powerful product rule. Simple conditions are obtained for metric-compatibility and torsion-freeness of the connection coefficients, and derivatives with torsion are treated generally. The covariant derivative of tensor fields is derived from a simple chain rule. Arbitrary metric signatures are treated in generality. The curved-manifold equivalents of the gradient, divergence, and curl operators are investigated, and the torsion-free curl is shown to be equivalent to the exterior derivative of differential forms. Unlike most traditional treatments, the entire formalism is developed in terms of completely arbitrary vector bases, which might be neither coordinate bases nor orthonormal. Methods of geometric algebra have previously been applied to vector calculus with great success, and extended to curved spaces in several ways (notably including ``vector manifolds'' and ``gauge theory gravity''). Here we provide a new way of extending geometric calculus to curved manifolds, which more closely parallels standard Riemannian geometry.},

  abstract   = {Non-scalar variational problems appear in different fields. In geometry, for in­ stance, we encounter the basic problems of harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds and of minimal immersions; related questions appear in physics, for example in the classical theory of a-models. Non linear elasticity is another example in continuum mechanics, while Oseen-Frank theory of liquid crystals and Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity require to treat variational problems in order to model quite complicated phenomena. Typically one is interested in finding energy minimizing representatives in homology or homotopy classes of maps, minimizers with prescribed topological singularities, topological charges, stable deformations i. e. minimizers in classes of diffeomorphisms or extremal fields. In the last two or three decades there has been growing interest, knowledge, and understanding of the general theory for this kind of problems, often referred to as geometric variational problems. Due to the lack of a regularity theory in the non scalar case, in contrast to the scalar one - or in other words to the occurrence of singularities in vector valued minimizers, often related with concentration phenomena for the energy density - and because of the particular relevance of those singularities for the problem being considered the question of singling out a weak formulation, or completely understanding the significance of various weak formulations becames non trivial.},

In §1 necessary and sufficient conditions for a Banach space \$X\$ to have the property that bounded additive \$X\$-valued maps on \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-algebras be strongly bounded are presented, namely, \$X\$ can contain no copy of \$\{l\_{\textbackslash}infty \}\$. The next two sections treat the Jordan decomposition for measures with values in \$\{L\_1\}\$-spaces on \$\{c\_0\}({\textbackslash}Gamma )\$ spaces and criteria for integrability of scalar functions with respect to vector measures. In particular, a different proof is presented for a result of D. R. Lewis to the effect that scalar integrability implies integrability is equivalent to noncontainment of \$\{c\_0\}\$. The final section concerns the Radon-Nikodym theorem for vector measures. A generalization of a result due to E. Leonard and K. Sundaresan is given, namely, if a Banach space \$X\$ has an equivalent very smooth norm (in particular, a Fréchet differentiable norm) then its dual has the Radon-Nikodym property. Consequently, a \$C({\textbackslash}Omega )\$ space which is a Grothendieck space (weak-star and weak-sequential convergence in dual coincide) cannot be renormed smoothly. Several open questions are mentioned throughout the paper.},
